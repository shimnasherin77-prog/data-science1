# AI and ML
* AI means making computers or machines think and act like humans.
* ML is a part of AI that helps machines learn from data automatically — without being directly programmed.

## BROADCASTING
```import numpy as np
# 7. Subtract two arrays
# Given:
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])
b = np.array([[10],
              [20],
              [30]])
# → Subtract a - b using broadcasting. What is the result shape?
c=a-b
print(c.shape)
```
